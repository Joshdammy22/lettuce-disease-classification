# lettuce-disease-classification
This project develops a web-based system for identifying lettuce diseases using machine learning. It includes two classification phases: detecting if a plant is healthy or diseased and identifying the specific disease. The dataset includes images from Kaggle, Roboflow, and LASU farmlands, ensuring diverse and accurate disease diagnosis.
